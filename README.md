# :house_with_garden: let & GO :house_with_garden:

## What this app is about

let & GO promotes sustainability :recycle: and communal sharing :couple: . This application allows users to rent out or lease their stuff to their neighbours and build up neighbourhood bonds. With let & GO, you never need to clutter your house with things you only use once or twice. You can finally meet your neighbours while earning some extra money :moneybag: by sharing your stuff that you haven't use for a while.

:star: _New technology learned during this project_

## Goals for this project

The goal of this project is to build a full-stack app using new technologies (see above) _not taught in the bootcamp_. I learned these new tools by reading documentations and watching tutorial videos.

- practice full-stack development
- practice learning new technology independently
- apply what we learned in the bootcamp
- showcase development approach of using wireframes and user stories
- practice disciplined [git usage](#git-workflow)

## User Stories and Wireframe

### User stories for this project:

- As a user, I would like to sign up and login. I must register before I can make an offer
- As a user, I am able to create a profile to see my information and history of transactions
- As a user, I would like to search for items at specific locations
- As a user, I would like to see a dashboard. In this dashboard, I am able to see other usersâ€™ offers
- As a user, I can click into a post on the dashboard and look at the details of the item
- As a user, I would like to contact the item owner for meet up arrangements
- As a user, I would like to make payments online for renting an item

_This mvp is still a work in progress. Some features still need to be implemented and revised. If you have any suggestions, please let me know [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicole-kuong/)_
